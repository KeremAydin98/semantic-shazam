## Introduction

This project aims to classify and summarize songs based on their lyrics. That's why I called this project Semantic Shazam, since it builds on the meaning of the song lyrics instead of the music sound. For the given song lyric, it returns the summarization of the song lyrics, most similar songs in the dataset and finally genre of the song.

## Extracting semantics

But how do we make the computer understand meaning? Word embeddings are the solution of the researchers. They capture the meaning by comparing neighboring words, since similar words would have the same context words. That is actually what humans do in case we do not know the meaning of a word in a sentence. We look at other words of that sentence and try to derive a meaning. 

Word2Vec is the algorithm that I have just explained. It is used to train word embeddings. Word embeddings are just fixed sized vectors. Train set is extracted with a sliding windows that goes from left to right. The algorithm tries to predict the center word' vector from the neighboring words' vectors(it can also be done in the opposite way). This is called Continuous Bag of Words method.

As Jay Alammar stated, these vectors can derive interesting connections between words such as "king - man + woman = queen" in his great explanation of Word2Vec algorithm:

Just like that we derived the meaning of words, but I needed to find connections between songs. Therefore, I also needed paragraph vectors for songs besides word vectors. For these kind of tasks, Doc2Vec algorithm is utilized. The method is very similar to the Word2Vec. There is only one difference which is that with every prediction of the center word another vector called paragraph vector is trained next to the neighboring word vectors.

**Gensim** library already had a doc2vec implementation. I only had one adjustment to the train set. Not every word add a meaning to the sentence like "the", "a" or etc. These kind of words are called stop words in the literature. I have removed them by using **spacy** library. 

## What can Semantic Shazam do?

### 1. Genre classification

The dataset contained many unique genres. So I have only chosen the most frequent ones. 
The main genre list contained:

"Pop, Rom√¢ntico, Pop/Rock, R&B, Rap, Electronica, Rock, Blues, Jazz, Folk, Country, Heavy Metal". 

The inputs for the model were the paragraph vectors of the songs that we derived while training with Doc2Vec algorithm. And the desired output is the genre of the song. I have turned both of the inputs and outputs to the tf.data.Dataset format and did a batching process on them. The structure of ANN model for the classification task can be seen below:

```
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(512, activation="relu"),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(512, activation="relu"),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(output_size, activation="softmax"),
    ])

    model.compile(loss=tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy(),
                  optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(),
                  metrics=["accuracy"])
```

The loss is Categorical Cross Entropy because I turned genres into one hot encoding format using tf.one_hot method. 

The model reached over %60 accuracy, it does not seem a lot but you have to remember that the model is only guessing song genres from the words in the lyrics. Also some of the genres are very close to each other, it is sometimes hard to distinguish them. The confusion matrix of the model's predictions can be seen below:
